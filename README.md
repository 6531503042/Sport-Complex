# Sport-Complex
This project is part of 1305308	Platform Development Course.
 ![alt text](assets/image.png)
## Overview

This project aims to redesign the existing sport complex system to improve its scalability, performance, and user experience. The primary goals are to handle a larger number of users, enable easy scaling using a Kubernetes cluster, and leverage modern technologies like Golang, Echo, gRPC, and Kafka for efficient communication and interaction.

- **Facility Service**: Manages information about available facilities and their pricing.
- **Notification Servic**: Sends notifications to users about bookings, cancellations, and other updates.
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing and integration with payment gateways.
- **Middleware**: Acts as a gateway for incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate services.
- **Kafka**: Used for asynchronous communication between services, especially for events like booking confirmations and payment updates.
