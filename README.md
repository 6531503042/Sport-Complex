## Overview

This project aims to redesign the existing sport complex system to improve its scalability, performance, and user experience. The primary goals are to handle a larger number of users, enable easy scaling using a Kubernetes cluster, and leverage modern technologies like Golang, Echo, gRPC, and Kafka for efficient communication and interaction.

## Features

- **User Management**: Register and manage users, including guests and different roles (e.g., campus users, outsiders, guest).
- **Activity Booking**: Book activities such as gym sessions, swimming, and badminton courts.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Support for different pricing based on user roles (insiders, outsiders) and activities.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with Kubernetes for handling large numbers of concurrent users.
- **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes gRPC for fast and efficient communication between services.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Employs Kafka for managing and processing asynchronous tasks.

## Architecture
![alt text](<assets/Screenshot 2567-09-01 at 21.57.59.png>)
The architecture should include the following components:

- **User Service**: Handles user registration, login, profile management, and other user-related functions.
- **Booking Service**: Manages booking of facilities, timeslots, and payments.
- **Facility Service**: Manages information about available facilities and their pricing.
- **Notification Servic**: Sends notifications to users about bookings, cancellations, and other updates.
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing and integration with payment gateways.
- **Middleware**: Acts as a gateway for incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate services.
- **Kafka**: Used for asynchronous communication between services, especially for events like booking confirmations and payment updates.
